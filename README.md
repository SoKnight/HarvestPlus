# HarvestPlus - Faster crops harvesting
Yet another simple Minecraft Spigot plugin for the one additional feature :/

Plugin works on the MC 1.16.X, old versions are not tested.

## The one additional feature
You can **harvest your crop** by clicking right mouse button on the crop block.
When you clicks on the block with crop, this **crop will be dropped nearby** and the **growing progress will be reset**.

Also, **plugin will not detect it when you sneaks and clicks** on the block.
